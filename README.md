# Gait-Analysis

Project Idea: https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sensors/sensors-21-06202/article_deploy/sensors-21-06202.pdf
Timeline: 1 month to understand the project description and learn the relevant concepts.

Project Work:
Project Domain: Deep Learning.
Prerequisite: preferred deep learning knowledge, else a quick learner of dl concepts.

End Result: An application which takes the input in the form a video. The next process is to break this video into cycles and use a DL model to predict the disease.
Work Completed: The application, Data Preprocessing & basic DL model.
Expectations from mentees: ready to take up any task given and complete before the given timeline. We are currently focusing on making the model a more interpretable.
